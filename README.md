# Minor-Project
# Weather App
# In this weather app project, users can enter any city name to get the 5-day weather forecast or simply click on the “Use Current Location” button to get their current location’s weather details, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more. This project is also mobile-friendly, which means it looks great on all devices.
# Project plan:
# To create weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we need to follow  these steps:
# 1.	Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
# 2.	Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
# 3.	Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
# 4.	Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js
# The code includes a weather app header, input, button, and unordered list (ul) that are used as a placeholder for weather details. Later, using JavaScript, we’ll replace these placeholders with actual weather details.
# Now we will add the desired code in index.html,style.css  in  order to  load the web page in your browser, you will see the header at the top, a sidebar with input and buttons, and weather detail placeholders. You can customize this code to your liking by adjusting the color, font, size, and other CSS properties.
# After that we will add code in script.js file as This script code will make your weather app functional, which means now you can get a 5-day weather forecast for any city or your current location.
# In the code, there are two API calls. The first one fetches the geographic coordinates of the user-entered city. These coordinates are then used in the second API call to retrieve the weather forecast, which is displayed on the page. The code also includes a feature that asks for user location permission and, once granted, makes the second API call to fetch the weather forecast based on the user’s current location. We will get an error like “Invalid API Key” or something when we don’t  set the API key so we need to  set the API key using openweathermap by  creating an account at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. 
# Now we can run the code and the desired result can be shown in the form of website where  we can get the detail about the current weather condition of an area and some more details about further 5 days weather of that particular area.

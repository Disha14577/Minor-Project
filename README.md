## Why I consider building a weather app?
‚Ä¢	Creating a weather website can be a fulfilling project that serves a broad audience. With the right set of tools and a well-thought-out approach, your website can become a go-to resource for weather information.
‚Ä¢	High Demand and Utility which means Weather websites are visited regularly, fostering repeat traffic.
‚Ä¢	building a weather app project allows you to apply your web development skills to a real-world application.
‚Ä¢	it helps you to better understand DOM manipulation, Event handling, CSS styling, APIs, and more.
‚Ä¢	Weather websites can generate revenue through ads, affiliate marketing, premium subscription services (like ad-free access or advanced data), or partnerships with businesses in travel, outdoor gear, or agriculture.
‚Ä¢	a weather website isn't just a functional platform‚Äîit's a versatile project with potential for innovation, profit, and meaningful impact.
‚Ä¢	A weather website can foster an engaged community by offering localized features. Users may share updates, storm reports, or photos, helping to build trust and expand your platform organically.

## Getting Started
#### Steps To Create Weather App in HTML & JavaScript
To create your weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js

## Setup & Installation

You can easily set up this weather app locally by following these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Clone the repository (Optional)

If you want to clone the repository and run it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
    cd weather-app
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

   You don't need any server or backend for this app since it's fully frontend-based.

### API Key

This app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather data. If you're planning to use it for personal purposes or modifications, you may need to create your own API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

- Once you have your key, you can replace the existing API key in the JavaScript file.

```javascript
const apikey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace this with your API key.  

## Notes
your weather app is still unable to show the weather forecast for any location if you‚Äôve not provided your OpenWeatherMap API key in the API_KEY variable. To get a free API key, sign up for an account at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. Your API key may take minutes or hours to activate. You‚Äôll get an error like ‚ÄúInvalid API Key‚Äù or something similar during this time.
